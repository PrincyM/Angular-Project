# Angular-Project
Aim: This repo is to track our progress for Humber Angular Project that includes building a single page application (SPA) with RESTful APIs

Description: Team Potfolio is a single page application that includes profile information and projects done by the team of developers
who built this application. It is built using Angular 2 with Bootstrap to make it responsive. 

Princy: I worked on the SPA introduction and team-member component, model and service that gives a simple introduction about the SPA and shows the team members
profile information. 

team-member model: I have used the teamMember model to hold properties that would be relevant for a profile. 
team-member service: Imported sufficient dependencies (model, rxjs) in the team-member service and used a method to return 
objects array. Method is written using 'Observable' and 'of' to return contents of service. 

team-member component: Imported sufficient dependencies (model, service, etc.) in the team-member component files. The HTML 
for the component displays service contents to the user through a styled layout.
